## Credit

I want to give credit to [vfsfitvnm/ViMusic](https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/ViMusic) and [z-huang/InnerTune](https://github.com/z-huang/InnerTune) for being examples of Jetpack Compose music players. Their work has been a huge inspiration in my learning process for Compose and Android development.
